## Project Description:

### Data Source: AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) serves as the primary data source for managing Kubernetes applications and nodes. Fargate assists in handling worker nodes to ensure a robust and highly available Kubernetes cluster.

### Tools: EKS, Fargate, AWS CLI, Helm - used for managing, deploying, and streamlining Kubernetes applications within the cloud environment.

### Data Analysis: The project involves managing Kubernetes applications and nodes effectively within EKS, deploying applications into the EKS cluster, and setting up alert mechanisms for users to ensure effective monitoring.

### Results/Findings: Successful creation of EKS clusters, application deployments into the EKS environment, and the establishment of user alert systems.

### Recommendations: Continued monitoring and optimization of EKS clusters for efficiency, regular review of alerts for timely responses and improvements in security measures.

### Limitations: Dependencies on AWS services, potential complexities in managing multiple clusters, and some limitations in the flexibility of configurations.
